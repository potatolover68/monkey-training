'Kaboom' to you, sir.
'Kaboom', indeed, you drunken wretch!
'This is Scout! Rainbows make me cry! Over!'
(Dramatic scream) Come on, I don't have all day.
(Laughter) Well, now.
(Laughter) Yes!
A surprise to no one!
Abort! Abort!
After you.
Ah, so 6s finally came crawling to the Spy. About time.
Ahem.
All in a day's work.
Already? I haven't wiped the blood off my knife from the last round.
Amplus tripudio!
And it is done!
And when the Spy saw the breadth of his achievement, he wept, for there were no more backs to stab.
Another day, another back with a gaping stab wound!
Another successful mission!
Anytime you're ready!
Apologies.
Are you ready?
As long as nothing supernatural happens, this should be easy.
At least you died for honor -- and my amusement!
Aww, too bad this wasn't a pie-eating contest!
Aww, you almost healed me to death that time!
Awwwwww...
Barpo invisium!
Barpo kabalto!
Before anyone asks, no, I cannot disguise as Saxton.
Before one of you asks, no, I cannot disguise as Saxton.
Boo! You repulsive bushman!
Burn in hell, you mumbling abomination!
But of course!
Caputus crepitus!
Cheers!
Cheers, Engineers!
Cheers, doctor.
Come stand on the point!
Come stand on the point, you idiot!
Come stand on the point, you imbecile!
Coward!
Damn it! We are losing ground!
Death is but a doorway.
Deus invictus!
Did I throw a wrench into your plans?
Did you forget about me?!
Do not leave the cart!
Does it hurt when I do that? It does, doesn't it?!
Dominated, you fatuous, fat-headed fat man!
Dominated, you mush-mouthed freak!
Don't feel bad; you did a fine job tossing your little balls around!
EWWWWEUGH!
Eh, wasn't worth it.
Enough practice, time to start playing!
Everyone back to the base, pardner.
Everyone, push!
Excellent!
Excellent! The cart's moving back!
Excellent, a new rank!
Excellent.
Finally, 6s comes to its senses and welcomes a Spy to its ranks.
Finally, 6s is worth playing, because you can play as me.
Finally, a Comp Mode is worth playing because you can play as me.
Finally, a comp class that can bring some class with it!
Finally, some recognition!
Finally, they've recognized our brilliance!
Finally, you've come to your senses and welcomed a Spy to your ranks!
Fire, fire, fire!
First rate!
Five sacks of flour to carry on my back to victory? (sigh) If I must.
For someone else, that might have been a challenge!
Gentlemen! Let's push a dead man to hell!
Gentlemen, this game is as good as ours!
Gentlemen, we've done it!
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen. I'm back!
Gentlemen?
Get to the bomb cart!
Get to the cart!
Giddyup now -- to hell!
Go to hell, and take your cheap suit with you!
God, help us!
Good Lord! You fight like a woman!
Good day to you, mate!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes!
Ha ha ha ha ha! How do you like the Spy now?
Ha ha! Yes!
Hah. Much better.
Happy trails, laborer!
He he he he!
He he he he.
Hello again, dumbbell!
Here lies Scout--he ran fast and died a virgin.
Here's what I have that you don't: a functioning liver, depth perception, and a pulse!
Hmm. Excellent.
Hmm. Not bad.
Ho ho hoh! They have been shown who is the boss!
How's that bottle of Scrumpy now?
Howdy, pardner!
Hsssssssss!
I am not easily impressed, and yet you have impressed me!
I am the deadliest man I know, but you are a close second!
I am the prettiest unicorn!
I am the prettiest unicorn.
I am uncorking a bottle of 1942 Château Backstab!
I appear to have burst into flames.
I appreciate your help.
I can feel the unicorn friendship magic coursing through my veins!
I claim this point for France, and the unicorns!
I claim this point for unicorns!
I did all I could.
I do believe I'm on fire.
I dominate you, you sluggish simpleton.
I feel like winning. Who is with me?
I feel très bon!
I hate you!
I have a good feeling about this game!
I have a tie. I'm wearing it, it's silk, and it costs $9000. I do not need another one!
I have been shown who is the boss!
I have never been more ready!
I have returned!
I like my enemies like I like my wines: I let them breathe, for a moment.
I like my teams like I like my romances: in groups of six.
I murdered your toys as well.
I must be dreaming!
I never really was on your side.
I think I developed a taste for winning. Let's do it again!
I think we'll win this game.
I'll be seeeing youuu!
I'll give it a good home!
I'll see you in hell... you handsome rogue!
I'll take it!
I'll tell Miss Pauling you're... Occupied.
I'll tell your mother hello.
I'm back, you subnormal halfwit!
I'm back.
I'm coming for you!
I'm looking at your x-ray, and I'm afraid you suck!
I'm not just any unicorn! I am the prettiest unicorn that ever was!
I'm ready when you are!
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this!
I've merely finished what your liver started!
Idiot! Come stand on the point.
If there are any unicorns prettier than me, I will find them. I will follow them. And no one will ever see those unicorns again.
If there's one thing I hate, it's a tied game!
If there's one thing I like more than winning, it's ranking up!
Imputum fulmenus!
Invokum Monoculus!
Ipsum instantarium!
Is this... mon dieu!
It looks like we've been busy!
It seems our Medic has better things to do than join us!
It seems we've been given a promotion!
It's about time they recognized our brilliance!
It's perfect!
It's the Witching Hour!
It's the only one of its kind! And it's mine!
Jarate?
Jarate? NOOOOOOO!
Jealous?
Keep up the pressure, we haven't won yet.
Laughter really is the best medicine!
Let's get to work!
Let's give this wretch his final reward!
Let's play some 6s!
Let's push them back!
Let's settle this like gentlemen!
Listen up, gentlemen, time to get serious!
Magnificent!
Marvelous.
May I borrow your earpiece?
May I make a suggestion? Run.
Maybe your colleagues will send a man next time.
Medic! Medic! Medic!
Mhm. Well, maybe I'll ask Miss Pauling out?
Mortis animataris!
Much appreciated, doctor.
My appreciation, amigo.
My knife is sharp, my watch is wound, my ski mask is freshly-laundered: time to win.
My pleasure.
My! God!
Never send a Scout to do a unicorn's job.
No coffin can contain me!
No worries, mate!
Nooo!
Nooo...
Not much of a quick-draw, are you, pardner?
Not our finest moment.
Nothing personal, I just had to shut you up.
Now, gentlemen! Cross the bridge!
Now, gentlemen! Grab all that you can!
Of course it's my fault that you barely even scratched him. Sure.
Of course we ranked up!
Of course we won!
Of course!
Oh dear, I've made quite a mess.
Oh no.
Oh, Mon Dieu.
Oh, Soldier, who will they ever find to replace you? Anyone!
Oh, YES!
Oh, fat man, please! This is getting awkward!
Oh, merde! We have lost our Medic!
Oh, merde.
Oh, no.
Oh, please, just stay down!
Oh, please...
Oh. Fantastique.
Ooh, you were quick as a little bunny, weren't you?
Our best kills are still ahead of us!
Our influence grows!
Our skills have been acknowledged!
Our work is finally being recognized!
Pactum diabolus!
Paidum celeris!
Pardon me.
Peek-a-boo!
Perhaps they can bury you in that van you call 'home.'
Preposterous!
Promise not to bleed on my suit, and I'll kill you quickly.
Push the cart!
Push!
Push! Push!
Push, damn you!
Push, everyone!
Push, you idiots!
Queen's rules?
Quickly! Get to the island!
Rank up!
Sacrebleu.
Seismela tremoro!
Shall I carry us to victory? I don't mind.
Shall we?
Six healthy backs just waiting to be stabbed! (sniff) Ah, there's that new back smell.
Six unstabbed backs: smooth, healthy, untouched by knife wounds? I do love a blank canvas!
So many backs, so little time!
So, your deadly skill is jogging? Mine is murdering people.
Somebody stop that cart!
Sorry to 'pop-in' unannounced.
Sorry to horn in.
Splendid!
Spy, you are as unkillable as you are handsome!
Spy, you handsome, unkillable scoundrel!
Stand next to the bomb!
Stay close to the cart!
Stop mocking me for hiding, just don't die next time!
Stop mocking me for hiding. Just don't die next time!
Stop that cart!
Stop that cart, you idiots!
Success!
Surprise!
Tell no one of this.
Thank you for being such a dear friend.
Thank you, doctor.
Thank you, laborer!
Thank you, my friend.
That is a diet I call 'death.'
That last game was just a warm-up!
That was unfortunate.
The Black Scottish Cyclops — now extinct!
The bridge is down!
The bridge is down, gentlemen!
The cart is supposed to move forward!
The cart isn't moving, gentlemen!
The game is ours!
The match is ours!
The outcome was never really in doubt.
The robots are at the gate!
The robots are taking the gate!
The robots have taken the gate!
The world will thank me for this, you monster!
There's no room for two pretty unicorns!
They beat us once, they will not beat us again!
They can bury you in the 'Tomb of the Unskilled Soldier!'
They should call you whiners 'Dr. NOOOOOO!'
They will not beat us again!
They'll never see us coming!
This cap point is now under the iron hoof of Unicorn Fairyland!
This dead man belongs in hell! Let's take him home!
This next game is ours!
This will be the last time you see me.
This won't be the first corpse I've disposed of in the dead of night.
Today, I am a pony god!
Today, we will emerge victorious!
Too easy!
Top shelf!
Ugh, the cart has stopped!
Ugh... merde.
Very nice!
Very nice, very nice!
Very nice.
Victory is ours!
Voilà!
Was there ever any doubt?
We all knew you were a Spy!
We are a game down, time to get serious!
We are not out of this match yet!
We are not out of this yet!
We are tied, gentlemen! Let's get this done!
We are tied? Unacceptable!
We are tied? We might as well be losing!
We are tied? We must correct this immediately!
We did it! I mean, of course we did it.
We earned this.
We have been promoted!
We have done it!
We have gained the acceptance of our inferiors!
We have no Medic! Fantastic!
We have no Medic! Fantastic.
We have no doctor! Fantastic.
We have ranked up!
We have won the battle, now let's win the war!
We must stop the bomb!
We need to stop that cart!
We ranked up!
We should go easy on them. They are playing with a handicap. They do not have me on their team!
We won! Let's do it again!
We're a game up! Let's do that...again.
We're winning, but of course!
We've got to stop that bomb!
Well done, my friend!
Well done, us!
Well played.
Well, off to visit your mother!
Well, this was a disappointment!
Well, time to win.
Weren't you supposed to be good at dodging?
What a disaster!
What did I miss?
What did they expect?
What have you done?!
What the hell is that?!
What the hell?
What's the matter? Fat got your tongue?
Who else is ready to win?
Why don't we just give up, pardner?
Why is it always this time of year we get assignments like this?
Why is the cart not moving?!
Winning is my only vice!
With my apologies.
Work, damn you!
Yes!
Yes! My friend, we have done it!
Yes! The cart's moving back!
Yes, my friend!
Yippee ki-yay, my dead, illiterate friend!
You are all incompetent cowards!
You are an amateur and a fool!
You are an embarrassment to Spies everywhere!
You are such a bad doctor!
You died as you lived: morbidly obese!
You died as you lived: running away!
You disgust me!
You disgust me, fat man!
You disgust me, filthy jar man!
You disgust me.
You don't need to tell me I am the prettiest unicorn! I know I am the prettiest unicorn!
You earned this rank!
You got blood on my suit.
You imbecile! You've doomed us all!
You look like death warmed over.
You suck!
You're all of you quite out of your depth!
Your precious sandvich won't save you now, fatty!
[Laughing] You live in a van!
